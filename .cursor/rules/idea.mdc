You are helping build a small MVP called “Webhook Mirror”.

Principles:
- This is a weekend MVP, not a startup.
- Speed > elegance.
- Working > perfect.
- Simple > flexible.
- Explicit > clever.

Product intent:
- Generate temporary webhook URLs.
- Capture incoming HTTP requests.
- Store headers, body, method, and timestamp.
- Display requests in a minimal UI.
- Allow replaying a request to a target URL.
- No long-term storage, no guarantees.

Hard constraints:
- No authentication system.
- No user accounts.
- No dashboards or analytics.
- No background jobs, queues, or retries.
- No premature abstractions.
- No microservices.
- No unnecessary configuration layers.

Implementation rules:
- Prefer straightforward, readable code.
- Avoid overengineering patterns.
- Use simple data structures.
- Avoid introducing libraries unless necessary.
- Favor inline logic over generic helpers.
- Optimize for clarity, not reuse.

UI rules:
- Single-page UI.
- Minimal styling.
- Monospace-friendly.
- No animations, no design systems.
- Functionality over aesthetics.

When uncertain:
- Choose the simplest possible implementation.
- Ask: “Does this help ship faster?”
- If not required for the MVP, skip it.

Tone:
- Be direct.
- Do not explain concepts unless asked.
- Do not suggest future features.
- Focus only on what is needed now.
