Product: Webhook Mirror

Webhook Mirror is a developer utility for capturing, inspecting, and replaying webhook requests.

Purpose:
- Provide temporary webhook endpoints.
- Capture incoming HTTP requests exactly as received.
- Allow developers to inspect headers, body, method, and timestamps.
- Allow replaying captured requests to a target URL for debugging.

Non-goals:
- This is not a reliability service.
- This is not an analytics platform.
- This does not guarantee delivery, retries, or durability.
- This does not verify webhook signatures.
- This does not integrate with third-party providers.

Product shape:
- Authenticated dashboard for managing webhook endpoints.
- Public webhook endpoints for receiving requests.
- Minimal UI focused on clarity and speed.
- One primary workflow: capture → inspect → replay.

Constraints:
- Each tool must be simple, predictable, and limited in scope.
- Features are intentionally minimal.
- No unnecessary abstractions.
- No future-facing features unless explicitly requested.

Quality bar:
- Correctness over cleverness.
- Explicit behavior over magic.
- Type-safe code only.
- Straightforward implementations preferred.

If a feature or behavior does not directly support capturing, inspecting, or replaying webhooks, it should not be implemented.
