Naming Convention Rule

Context-aware naming is mandatory. Do not mix conventions.

Next.js (frontend, routing, public-facing)

Use kebab-case.

Applies to:

App Router folders and routes
app/webhook-mirror/page.tsx

URL paths
/api/rate-limit

Public file names
open-source-policy.md

CSS classes
user-profile-card

Reason:

URLs, filesystems, and humans prefer kebab-case

Case-insensitive safe

Industry standard for web interfaces

Do NOT use camelCase or snake_case in routes or public paths.
