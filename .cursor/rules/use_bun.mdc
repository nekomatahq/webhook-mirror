Node-specific globals or assumptions (process unless Bun-compatible)

Scope

Applies to:

Local development

CI workflows

Scripts

Tooling

MDC automation

All commands, docs, and examples must assume Bun by default.

Dependency Rule

Dependencies must:

Be compatible with Bun

Avoid Node-only native bindings unless verified

Prefer web-standard or Bun-first libraries

If a dependency requires Node-specific behavior:

It must be justified explicitly

Or replaced

Documentation Rule

All README instructions use Bun

No alternative runtime instructions

No “Node.js also works” language

This project is Bun-first, Bun-only.

Enforcement

If a script or doc references Node or npm:

Treat it as a violation

Fix it immediately

Do not add compatibility layers

Runtime ambiguity causes entropy.
Bun removes it.
