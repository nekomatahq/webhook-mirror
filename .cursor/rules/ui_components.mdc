Rule

Use shadcn/ui as the only UI component source.

Do not use other UI libraries (MUI, Chakra, AntD, Mantine, etc.).

Do not import Radix components directly.

If a needed component does not exist, install it via shadcn, never re-implement or pull from another library.

Custom components are allowed only when composed from shadcn components and Tailwind utilities.

Installation Policy

All shadcn components must be installed via Bun.

Never copy/paste components manually.

Never use npm, npx, pnpm, or yarn.

Command

bunx shadcn@latest add <component>


Styling

Tailwind only.

Theme changes through CSS variables or Tailwind config.

No inline styles unless unavoidable.

Enforcement Mindset

shadcn is the design system.

The repo owns the components.

Fewer abstractions, fewer dependencies, fewer regrets.

If you want, I can make this even stricter:

Cursor rule that rejects suggestions using other UI libs.

ESLint rule to block forbidden imports.

A “shadcn first, build later” decision checklist.
