Rule

Nekomata HQ offers one paid plan only: Nekomata Suite.

There are no per-tool subscriptions, no tiers per product, no feature gating per app.

A single subscription grants full access to all Nekomata tools, present and future.

Subscription Cards

Pricing pages must display one subscription card only.

The card copy must communicate:

Full access to the entire Nekomata Suite

Tools are listed individually with their own feature sets

No separate checkout per tool

Allowed Copy (conceptual)

“Get full access to the Nekomata Suite”

“One subscription. All tools.”

“All current and future Nekomata tools included”

“Features are defined per tool, not per plan”

Disallowed

Tool-specific pricing

Multiple plans (Starter, Pro, Enterprise, etc.)

Upgrade/downgrade logic between tools

Feature matrices comparing tools against each other

Product Philosophy

Users subscribe to Nekomata, not to tools.

Tools are expressions of the same ecosystem.

Pricing stays boring so the software can be sharp.

Design Implications

One CTA: Get full access

Tool pages describe what the tool does, not how much it costs.

Billing logic lives at the account level, never the tool level.

Future Rule

Any new tool automatically ships as part of the Suite.

No pricing discussion is allowed at the tool launch level.

This keeps Nekomata clean, confident, and non-desperate.
No nickel-and-diming. No “growth hacks”. Just “this is the suite, take it or don’t”.
